# Notes for developing Hydra.

## bundle.js 

The `hydra-server/public/bundle.js` file is committed to Git because it
improves performance in the <https://hydra-editor.glitch.me/> instance.

This file is generated by [browserify](https://github.com/browserify/browserify) from the source code in `hydra-server/app`.

If you see Git merge conflicts involving this file, you can fix them by running:

    npm run build-main

Then `git add` the bundle.js file.
